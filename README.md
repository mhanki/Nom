Does this ever happen to you? You happily code away on a project, navigating the command line like a pro, testing, error logging, installing packages.... wait: "nom command not found"? Not again!! 🤦🏻‍♀️  
For everyone who also has a relentless tendency to mistype "npm" as "nom", I feel you. Adopt this hungry little turtle to cheer you up.

## Installation
```
npm install -g @mhanki/nom
```

## Usage

From now on, every time you happen to hit that dreaded "o" instead of "p" when working with npm, you will feed this little turtle instead of being prompted with a bland "command not found" message. Enjoy! 🍓
